What the ArmoredJava Class does:

1.the int arrays(s1, s2... to sEntered ) store ascii value of characters, which are converted to char type by the function printEggs.

2.the function main uses printEggs to outputs several strings from int arrays, and decides whether the number input by the user is positive, zero or negative.

3.handle the edge case: if the the input is a non-integer number or not-a-number string, it outputs "i dont think it is a number."
